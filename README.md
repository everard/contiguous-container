This repository contains implementation of a contiguous container. This container satisfies most of the requirements of a container and of a reversible container
(given in two tables in 23.2 of the Standard), of a sequence container, including most of the optional sequence container requirements (23.2.3 of the Standard).
In order for it to fully satisfy a container and allocator-aware container requirements, specified template argument should provide needed constructors (see 23.2 of the Standard).
